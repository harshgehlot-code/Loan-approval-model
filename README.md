its a ML model which predict the loan approval status of user.
# Loan Approval Prediction - Machine Learning Model

This repository contains a Machine Learning model that predicts whether a loan application will be approved or not based on applicant data. The entire model development process is performed using **Google Colab**.

## 📌 Project Overview

Loan approval is a critical task in the banking sector. This project uses historical data and machine learning techniques to automate the process of predicting whether a loan should be approved.

## ✅ Features

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Model Training and Evaluation
- Model Comparison (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.)
- Final Prediction Output

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is usually in CSV format and contains features such as:

- Gender
- Marital Status
- Dependents
- Education
- Employment Status
- Applicant Income
- Loan Amount
- Credit History
- Property Area
- Loan Status (Target Variable)

> You can use datasets from platforms like Kaggle or other open-source data repositories.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open the provided `.ipynb` file in **Google Colab**.
2. Upload the dataset file (e.g., `loan_data.csv`) to your Colab environment.
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially.
4. The model will output predictions and evaluation metrics.
